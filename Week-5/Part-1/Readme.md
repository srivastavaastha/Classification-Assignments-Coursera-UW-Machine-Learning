# Exploring Ensemble Methods
## Goal
Explore the use of boosting.
## Implementation
* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Train a boosted ensemble of decision-trees (gradient boosted trees) on the lending club dataset.
* Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
* Evaluate the trained model and compare it with a baseline.
* Find the most positive and negative loans using the learned model.
* Explore how the number of trees influences classification performance.
