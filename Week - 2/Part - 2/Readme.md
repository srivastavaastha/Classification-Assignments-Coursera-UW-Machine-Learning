# Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
## Goal
implement your own logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization
## Algorithm
Logistic Regression
## Implementation
* Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
* Convert an dataframe into a NumPy array.
* Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.
* Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.
* Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting.
## Files used
* .ipynb is assignment solution.
* .zip is dataset.
* .json is 193 significant word file which we have used in solution file
