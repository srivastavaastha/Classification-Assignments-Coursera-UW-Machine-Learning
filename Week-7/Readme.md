# Training Logistic Regression via Stochastic Gradient Ascent
## Goal
Implement a logistic regression classifier using stochastic gradient ascent
## Implementation
* Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
* Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
* Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function (with L2 penalty) with respect to a single coefficient.
* Implement stochastic gradient ascent with L2 penalty
* Compare convergence of stochastic gradient ascent with that of batch gradient ascent
