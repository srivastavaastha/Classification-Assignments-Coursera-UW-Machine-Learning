# Predicting sentiment from product reviews
## Goal
Explore logistic regression and feature engineering with existing Turi Create functions
## Algorithm 
Logistic Regression
## Implimentation
* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering
* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the accuracy of the model.
* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
* Compare multiple logistic regression models.
## Files Used
* .ipynb is assignments solution file.
* Dataset file is a large file which cann't be uploaded due to github size restriction.
